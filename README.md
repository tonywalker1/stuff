# stuff

Miscellaneous, random, eclectic C++ code and other stuff. ;-)

# Summary

This library is my attempt to collect code I have written over the years into
a shareable and reusable form.

It has the following properties:
* Attempts to use the latest C++ standard, techniques, and practices.
* Attempts to use only the standard library or libraries that are in development
for the standard library.
* Should work on GCC and Clang.
* Should work on any modern Linux (I use Debian)

I really have no plan for this library and it could grow in many directions
should anyone want to help. Hint. Hint. ;-)

# Dependencies

See the code for a definitive list, but as for now:
* Catch2 (https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
* libfmt (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)

# Contributing

I would love suggestions, fixes, and other contributions. Feel free to discuss
major additions.

If you find this library useful, I would love to hear about it!
